# Project_1_Room_3# <The Zen Hub>

## Description

Our Interactive weather app is a digital application designed to provide users with real-time and accurate weather information in an engaging and user-friendly manner. It offers a range of features and functionalities that enable users to stay informed about current weather conditions, saved favorite cities and suggestions for activities based on the forecasted weather. 

Our motivation was to create a very successful widget, intended to be more than a weather widget that gives the user fun suggestions for activities to do based on the predicted weather. 

As a general  user, I want to be able to check the weather forecast for my city and/or surrounding cities, so that I can decide what I want to do for the day. 

As a user, I want to receive accurate and up-to-date weather information so that I can plan my activities accordingly, and have an added bonus of having the weather app suggest activities based on the weather. 

As a general user, I want an app to display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for the user's location. The app should have a visually appealing user interface that is easy to navigate and use. The app should have a feature that allows the user to look up weather information for specific cities or regions. The app should provide sunrise and sunset times, if available. The app should have an option to save favorite locations for quick access to their weather information. The app should be compatible with both iOS and android devices.
